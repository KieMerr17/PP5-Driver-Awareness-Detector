## Dataset Content
The dataset used for the project shows greyscale images of singular eye open and eye closed images with a small amount of surrounding features. It uses 48,000 images split evenly into 2 sets, 'eyes open', 'eyes closed'. 

Identifying signs of tiredness in drivers is important for accident prevention and preserving lives, because driving while fatigued can result in severe and tragic outcomes. 

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kutaykutlu/drowsiness-detection).
